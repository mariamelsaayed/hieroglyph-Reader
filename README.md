# hieroglyph-Reader
Hieroglyphic reader lets you translate the hieroglyph symbols using image processing and deep  learning methods

The image passes through morphological filter first for edge detection and broken edges linkage to extract each symbol on it's own 

then the symbols passed to image classifier to fetch the translation

The source code can be found in the main branch 
Notebooks showing the code and outputs can be found in the notebooks folder
